OWASP Juice Shop is a demo website for a juice shop which sells different flavoured juices to its customers. Using this website, users can register themselves, login and buy different juice products as per their requirement. This site also has an option to order, add address and make payment online using different payment options and allow users to deliver their product online.

The idea behind using this website for writing end to end tests is that this site is built using Material UI and its a kind of difficult to work with locators on the material UI.
